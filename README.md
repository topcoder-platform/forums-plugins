# Vanilla Forums Addons
Vanilla Forums is a very customizable, flexible platform because there are many ways to hook into it without 
ever modifying its code.

## Notes

Before Vanilla 2.5 there were plugins, applications, and themes. 
Starting in Vanilla 2.5 all 3 of these have been combined into 1 format - Addons. 
An addon is capable of doing everything that each those 3 used to do. 

## How develop Addons

Please read [the documentation](https://docs.vanillaforums.com/developer/addons/) how develop addons.

## Installing Addons

1. Copy the folder contents into the `plugins` folder of Vanilla Forums.
The `plugins` folder holds all addons for Vanilla Forums. 

2. Clear the entire contents of the `cache` folder.
The `cache` folder is located underneath the root Vanilla Forums folder.
There are no any button to clear server cache in Admin dashboard.

3. Clear browser cache.

## Enabling Addons
1. Go to your `Dashboard`, then `Settings`, and select `Addons` at the bottom of the list on the left 
hand side panel. Navigate to the addons list and click `Enable` next to the plugin. 
Enabling the addon immediately makes it active and available.

2. After enabling some plugins will have a `Settings` 3-strip button that appear next to them in
the Addons list.

## Disabling Addons
1. Disabling an addon will remove whatever features it added, but it never destroys the data associated with it.
